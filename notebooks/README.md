# In-class exercises

The jupyter notebooks which will be added to this folder throughout the course 
were created by [Jonas Peters](http://web.math.ku.dk/~peters/index.html) and [Niklas Pfister](https://stat.ethz.ch/~pfisteni/).

Every few weeks we will have an exercise session instead of a normal lecture
during which you can work on these notebooks.

We would therefore encourage you to install jupyter on your laptop (see below). Please try to get things working but if there are persistent problems, it suffices to find one colleague who has a running version of jupyter: you can work on the jupyter notebooks in groups of two.

## Installation and setup

1. Essentially, there are the following two options to install jupyter:

    A. Installation via [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). 
    Anaconda includes python along with a number of packages such as juyter. If you are only interested in a minimal version of python, it is probably sufficient to install miniconda.
    
    B. Installation via pip. If you already have a running version of python and pip you can also use pip to install jupyter (see the instructions at the bottom of this [page](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)). In order for R to work you then also need to manually install the R package [IRkernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel/blob/master/README.md).

2. Download the relevant notebook contained in this folder.

3. Once you have a running version of jupyter, start it by running
`jupyter notebook` in your terminal. You can then check if everything is correctly set up by running the `setupNotebook.ipynb` notebook (use the R kernel). This also tells you which additional R packages you should have installed. 

4. Remind yourself on some [R syntax](http://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/base-r.pdf).
