    "This notebook aims to give you a basic understanding of invariant causal prediction for causal inference. \n",

    "The method's goal is as follows: Suppose we are given data $(\\mathbf{X}_1, Y_1), \\ldots, (\\mathbf{X}_n, Y_n)$ from a target variable $Y$ and $d$ predictors $\\mathbf{X}$. We are then trying to determine the causal parents $\\operatorname{pa}(Y) \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, d\\}$ of $Y$. The inference will be based on heterogeneity in the data (e.g. the data come from different interventional settings)."

Assume further that none of the interventions occurs directly on the variable $Z^0$.

For each of the $7$ regressions plot the residuals vs the fitted values (this is called a Tukey-Anscombe plot). For the empty set, visualize the marginal distribution of $Y$. In each figure, plot the data points from the first environment in \"blue\" and the points from the second environment in \"red\". Determine whether the corresponding conditional remains invariant across the two environments. What is the parent set? Hint: Think about which sets are definetly *not* the correct parent sets."

In this section we want to show that we can still apply a similar methodology even if this environment information is not known. All we need is a sequential ordering of the data. For example, the data could be grouped together for each environment or the interventions could change continuously across time. We illustrate this using the following toy example."
